## Syllabus - Digital Systems & Microcontrollers

***Objective***:

The objective of the DSM course is to expose students to fundamental concepts of digital design (combinatorial and sequential circuit design) and alongside see how such building blocks find its way into a popular micro controller such as an Arduino. The student shall also be introduced to controller architectureas a natural extension of combinatorial and sequential circuit design along with practical aspects of controller programming and interface.

***Course Topics***:

Boolean Algebra, Function Minimization, Number Systems, Combinatorial Circuit Design, I/O interface to microcontroller through combinatorial circuits, Comparator Circuits in microcontrollerLatches, Flip Flops, FSM, Sequential Circuit Design, Timers, Registers and Counters, PWM Timers in Embedded Controllers, USART Registers in Embedded Micro Controllers, Controller Communication through Shift RegistersController Programming and Interface
