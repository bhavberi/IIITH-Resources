'What are status pages ?'
Statuspage is a communication tool that helps you inform your users about outages and scheduled maintenance.

So here we present the status pages for our website:
  1. [BetterUpTime](https://iiith.betteruptime.com/)
  2. [Freshping](https://statuspage.freshping.io/59242-IIITHResources)
